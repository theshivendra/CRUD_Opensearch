# Approach Paper - Full-Stack CRUD Application with React + Vite, Quarkus, OpenSearch, and Keycloak Authentication  

---

## 1. Objective  
The objective is to build a full-stack CRUD application that allows users to manage data through a React + Vite frontend and a Quarkus backend, with data stored in an OpenSearch database. The solution integrates Keycloak for user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access and data integrity. The application aims to offer high performance, scalability, and real-time data retrieval, supporting a modern and seamless user experience.

## 2. Proposed Solutions  

### Approach: Full-Stack CRUD with Keycloak Integration  
This approach leverages React + Vite for the frontend and Quarkus for the backend to manage CRUD operations in OpenSearch. The Quarkus backend interacts with OpenSearch using its native client, and Keycloak is integrated on the frontend for secure user authentication and role-based authorization.

### 3.2 Description  
The full-stack application follows a microservices-based architecture, with the following key components:  

- **Frontend (React + Vite):**  
  The frontend handles user interaction, form submissions, and data visualization. It sends authenticated requests to the backend and displays responses.  

- **Backend (Quarkus):**  
  The backend exposes REST endpoints to perform CRUD operations and search functionality. It also validates requests and handles Keycloak token authentication.  

- **OpenSearch Database:**  
  OpenSearch is used to store and retrieve documents efficiently with full-text search capabilities.  

- **Keycloak Authentication:**  
  Keycloak secures the application by enforcing login and managing user roles. Users are authenticated before they can perform any CRUD operations.  

---

**Why is this Approach Effective?**  
- **React + Vite:** Offers a fast, lightweight, and modular UI development experience.  
- **Quarkus:** Optimized for cloud and containerized environments with high performance and developer-friendly features like live coding.  
- **OpenSearch:** Scalable and efficient storage for managing large datasets with full-text search.  
- **Keycloak:** Centralized, flexible authentication with support for OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and role-based access control.  

---

**Pros:**  
- Clear separation of frontend and backend responsibilities.  
- Secure and scalable solution with centralized authentication.  
- Optimized performance using native database client integrations.  

**Cons:**  
- Requires familiarity with Quarkus, OpenSearch, and Keycloak for smooth integration.  
- More complex than traditional monolithic applications.

### 3.3 Pre-requisites  

#### 3.3.1 Hardware Requirements  
- **Development Environment:** Any modern system capable of running Java and React.  
- **Deployment Environment:** Minimum server resources (2 CPU cores, 4 GB RAM recommended).  

#### 3.3.2 Software Requirements  
- **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu recommended).  
- **Java:** Version 17+.  
- **Maven:** Version 3.9.9+.  
- **Quarkus:** Version 3.17+.  
- **OpenSearch:** Version 2.18+.  
- **Node.js:** Latest version to run Vite development server.  
- **Keycloak:** Latest stable version for centralized authentication.  

#### 3.3.3 Networking Requirements  
- **Frontend:** React app hosted on port 5173.  
- **Backend:** Quarkus API hosted on port 8080.  
- **OpenSearch:** Database accessible on port 9200.  
- **Keycloak:** Authentication server accessible on port 8180 (or configured port).  
- **Internet Access:** Required for dependency management and real-time data fetching.

## 4. Approach  

This approach integrates a modern, cloud-ready tech stack to meet the project’s requirements for performance, scalability, and security.  

- **Frontend Workflow:** The React app sends requests to the backend after authentication via Keycloak.  
- **Backend Workflow:** The Quarkus backend validates the user’s Keycloak token, processes the request, and interacts with OpenSearch for CRUD operations.  
- **Database Management:** OpenSearch stores user data and supports full-text search and indexing.  

**Key Features:**  
- Secure, token-based authentication using Keycloak.  
- Full CRUD functionality for managing user records and associated metadata.  
- Real-time data retrieval and efficient search capabilities using OpenSearch.

## Conclusion  

The full-stack CRUD solution leverages the combined power of React + Vite, Quarkus, OpenSearch, and Keycloak to build a secure, high-performance web application. With seamless integration across all layers, the application can handle large datasets and real-time user requests. The use of Keycloak ensures robust authentication, while Quarkus and OpenSearch provide efficient backend and data handling. This approach aligns with modern application standards and delivers a smooth user experience with optimal scalability and performance.
